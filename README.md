Sets Vim's `errorformat`, `commentstring` for associated Haskell filetypes.

I do not endorse this as good; I publish it so that others will not have to
venture in to the quagmire that is vim/vimscript.

Integrates with [vim-hoogle](https://github.com/Twinside/vim-hoogle), [alex syntax highlighting](https://github.com/andy-morris/alex.vim), [happy syntax highlighting](https://github.com/andy-morris/happy.vim).

You may also wish to consult [my notes](https://gist.github.com/vmchale/5f08a819f2c6d463887a0fa3eb7b2527) to provide jump-to-definition for Alex/Happy macros.
