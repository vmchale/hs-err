errorformat strings for Haskell projects                                *hs-err*

Three commands are provided, |CabalBuild|, |Hlint|, and |Cw|.

*CabalBuild*

This calls cabal asynchronously, populating /tmp/errors.

You may wish to run this only on files which are neglected by the language
server, viz.
>
    au BufRead,BufWritePost *.x,*.y,*.chs,*.hsc call CabalAsync()
<

Or you may wish to have it run on all Haskell files:

>
    au BufRead,BufWritePost *.hs,*.x,*.y,*.chs,*.hsc,*.cpphs call CabalAsync()
<

*Hlint*

This calls hlint asynchronously, populating /tmp/lints

If you are not using a language server to provide hlint information:

>
    au BufRead,BufWritePost *.hs,*.cpphs call Hlint()
<

*Cw*

This is like |cw|, but asynchronous.

It works by reading errors from /tmp/errors and appending anything in /tmp/lints.
